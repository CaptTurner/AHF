# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for At His Feet Band Website

## Overview
This PRD outlines the requirements for a website dedicated to the Christian band "At His Feet." The band specializes in worship, praise, and other Christian music across genres including folk, gospel, rock, and bluegrass. The website will serve as a central hub for fans, potential attendees, and the community to engage with the band's music, mission, and events. The band's guiding verse is Psalm 99:5: "Exalt the Lord our God and worship at his footstool; he is holy."

The primary goal of the website is to promote the band's music, foster spiritual connection, and facilitate community engagement while reflecting the band's Christian values and diverse musical styles.

## Problem Statement
Christian bands like At His Feet face challenges in reaching broader audiences due to fragmented online presence and lack of a dedicated platform to showcase their diverse musical offerings. Fans and potential supporters struggle to:
- Discover the band's music across multiple genres (folk, gospel, rock, bluegrass).
- Access information about upcoming events, such as concerts, worship services, or community gatherings.
- Connect with the band's mission and spiritual message, including the guiding verse from Psalm 99:5.
- Engage with the band through social media, newsletters, or direct contact in a cohesive manner.
- Purchase or stream music, merchandise, or donate to support the band's ministry.

Without a unified website, the band risks losing opportunities to build a loyal community, share their testimony, and expand their reach in the Christian music scene.

- Integration with social media and email newsletters for ongoing communication.
